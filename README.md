# FIFO and LIFO Stock Transaction Calculator

This project is designed to calculate both FIFO (First In, First Out) and LIFO (Last In, First Out) profits from stock transactions. It imports a list of transactions from a CSV or Excel file, processes the transactions to calculate gains based on both methods, and exports the results as a new Excel file with separate columns for FIFO and LIFO calculations.

## Purpose

The motivation behind this project stems from the fact that my broker does not support LIFO, while the German tax office requires FIFO for capital gains tax calculations. This tool provides an easy way to calculate both methods, ensuring compliance with tax regulations while still tracking LIFO for personal analysis.

## Features

- Import transactions from CSV or Excel
- Calculate both FIFO and LIFO profits
- Export the results to an Excel file with calculated gains
